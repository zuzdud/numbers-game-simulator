# Numbers Game Simulator

## Overview
This project implements a simple two-player Numbers Game simulator in C++. The goal of the simulation is to model interactions between players over multiple rounds and analyze whether the strategy presented in class yields the expected outcomes.

## Problem description
The Numbers Game is a basic game introduced in an Artificial Intelligence course at PWr. It involves two players, each of whom independently and simultaneously selects a number from the set {1, 2, 3}. The selected numbers are added together to compute the sum. If the sum is even, then Player 2 pays Player 1 the amount equal to the sum (in zlotys). If the sum is odd, then Player 1 pays Player 2 the amount equal to the sum.
